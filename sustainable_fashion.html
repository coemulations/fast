                      Fashion has been an essential part of cultures all around the world for centuries, but within the past few decades, it’s become the mecca of the world.

                    As I like to say, what you wear and how you wear it is a reflection of you and your story. Think about it: every day we make a decision on what we are going to wear.  What we choose leads us to ask the question: How does this make me feel? Fashion has the ability to change your whole attitude about how you feel about yourself and how you will conquer the day. Thinking about this from how I see myself, how my friends see themselves, and how the clients in Queer Eye see themselves, you know it makes a huge difference to your momentum and attitude about the day. While clothes are an essential part of one’s identity, we must also take into account the role the fashion industry plays in the environment and on the world as a whole. In today’s world, fast fashion is a key component in the rapidly accumulating waste that pollutes our environment. So, what is sustainable fashion and how is it making a difference?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Over the years as the fashion industry continues to boom, so does the amount of waste and pollution that contributed to the environment, bringing the fashion industry to 3rd place for the biggest polluters in the world. Brands we know and love since day one- such as Forever 21 & Zara - have contributed to the pollution of the environment by burning mass amounts of clothing that they can no longer be sold in stores or online. By burning a multitude amount of clothing, it creates a copious amount of greenhouse gases as well as carbon dioxide.
With the earth struggling already from plastic waste and other threats to the environment, it's unfortunate to see massive companies continue to contribute to the issue.
                  </p>


                  <p>
                    Although, it doesn’t seem as if all hope is lost. There are countless new startup companies that are coming out with revolutionary concepts that allow chic and trendy fashion, minus the environmental waste. You’ll see this with some brands (some of you may already be familiar with them) such as Reformation and Allbirds, using natural fabrics and dyes to create their unique pieces. Popular brands that have been around since our childhood such as the Banana Republic are also building efforts to create their timeless pieces but with sustainable efforts of organic fabrics along with how it's created and recycled.

                    <bold>“Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable—to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.” <bold>
                      It is a way in which big-box companies are trying to combat the harmful impact that fast fashion has created on the environment and human rights. As stated above, To name just a few of fast fashion’s effects are we see that it is a large cause of polluted water sources and unhealthy working conditions that pay less than a decent standard of living wages. Fast fashion is the second most destructive industry in the world and the rise of CSR seems to shine a light to expose the detriments that it has created.

                    Some of you may be wondering, “well how does sustainable fashion actually contribute to the environment?” As a matter of fact, it makes a huge difference. Not only does it reduce the number of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emitted into the air but it also reduces water waste, encourages recycling with unused fabrics, and ultimately reduces our carbon footprint. This may not seem like much, however with one piece of clothing, one store, one company at a time, we’re in for something good.

                    In addition to the corporate measures in CSR, the United Nations published 17 sustainability goals known as the SDGs. Each of the goals is set out to combat a major issue facing our world and close ties to combatting some of the very volatile effects that we also see in fast fashion.

                    For a more in-depth look into the world of fast fashion, the documentary The True Cost gives an eye-opening expose on the life cycle of an item of clothing. From the cotton that a shirt is produced; its production in a factory; its use by its consumer; its life at a charity shop; life in the dumpster; to its decomposition-- the life of an item of clothing is much longer than we think. The documentary seeks to teach us how we must view each of our clothing purchases as a long term investment that will have long-lasting impacts on the environment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I decided to get a first-hand perspective on the rise of what sustainable fashion is currently doing to rebrand the way that we think about purchasing our clothing. Amberlyn Saw, a senior in the business school has worked with Patagonia, Levi’s and PVH (whose portfolio includes Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and many other well-known brands) to help mitigate the environmental effects that fast fashion has created. She said one of the primary appeals of the sustainability in fashion is the tight-knit communities that surround a common cause. She explained that it is a niche environment that is just coming to popularity, so there are many people seeking to expand its influence and power to take a bigger role in more corporate settings. The fledgling industry is starting to gain traction with the general public as it appeals to those concerned with the harsh realities of climate change and changing our everyday purchasing habits to create a healthier, happier environment for all.

                    Sustainable fashion is a beacon that shines into the dark world of fast fashion. It is a lifestyle that will have an impact that lasts a lifetime. The environment is already struggling as it is but every step that we take to tackle the repercussions of the second most destructive industry in the world will offer more opportunities to improve the fashion industry and the environment. As we continue to join our efforts, we can make a difference in the world improving the greater good and the ecosystem around us- all while looking good.
